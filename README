Conedy is a scientific tool for the numerical integration of dynamical systems, whose mutual couplings are described by a network. Its name is an abbrevation of “Complex Networks with Dynamics”. It supplies functions to create and manipulate networks whose nodes may transport dynamics according to various integration schemes, including ordinary differential equations, dynamical maps, stochastic differential equations and pulse coupled elements which are handled via events. Conedy has support for automatic generation of C++ code to incorporate nodes with arbitrary dynamics. In addition, it provides a bief interface to standard task form the study of dynamical systems, like choosing initial conditions or parameter from random distributions.
